### Vision Statement:
System security and password integrity are a very common problem in todayâ€™s society. Users have so many accounts on different websites requiring login information, that it is often a user will forget a password. We are looking to make an application where the user can safely store and search their passwords, so when a situation may arise where they forget the password, they will be able to go into this application and find the password they are looking for.

### Domain terminology:

**- Password hashing** - The act of converting a password to an unreadable string 

**- Password Salting** - The practice of adding extra bits to a password string in order to prevent a malicious actor guessing the hashing technique
